# Machine vision exploration

## The snake Game
This was just to explore grids, pygame etc.

## Lidar Grid Map
The goal was to read LIDAR data from a CSV file, generate an occupancy grid map using ray casting, and visualize the results. 
The occupancy grid map represents the environment where obstacles and free spaces are marked based on the LIDAR readings.

## Edge detection
The objective was to perform lane detection on a road image. 
This involves detecting edges in the image and then using the Hough Line Transform to detect straight lines that represent the lane markers.

## Monocular depth
The goal was to use a pre-trained neural network model to generate a depth map from live webcam feed. 
The depth map represents the distance of objects from the camera, where closer objects appear brighter and farther objects appear darker.
